# Stochastic Analysis of Infinite-State Probabilistic Models

# Installation

- Prerequisites
    - Stormpy
        - Stormpy is a set of python bindings for the STORMâ€™s C++ API. The framework uses this library for building models, and checking the probability of properties on the built models.  Stormpy can be installed following the instructions showed [here](https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/installation.html#installation-steps).
    - STORM
        - The framework uses `storm-conv` binary to convert PRISM models to JANI models. STORM as the back-end probabilistic model checker. The instructions to compile STORM can be found [here](https://www.stormchecker.org/documentation/obtain-storm/build.html). The `storm-conv` binary is   After installation, the path to `storm-conv` binary should be declared in the JSON file passed to the framework.
    
    - z3-py
        - This framework uses z3 and its python bindings z3-py as the underlying SMT-solver. z3-py can added to the python interpreter by running the following command:    `pip install z3-solver` . More details on installation of z3-py can be found [here](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3?tab=readme-ov-file#z3-bindings).
    - Note: Both Stormpy and z3-py should be installed in the same python virtual environment.
- After installing the prerequisites, the python3 with the installed libraries can be used to run the framework.
    
    ```bash
	git clone --depth 1 --branch qest2024 https://github.com/fluentverification/bmc_counterexample.git
	cd bmc_counterexample
    
    ```
    

### Docker Image

Alternatively, a docker container with all the prerequisites libraries and case studies can be downloaded from the docker hub:

```bash
To be released soon.
```


# Running

The framework accepts CTMC models written in [PRISM modeling language](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/ThePRISMLanguage/Introduction) as input. Currently, the framework only accepts a restricted class of models where:

1. All commands in the model are labelled.
2. There is no module-renaming in the model.
3. Each command in the model must have exactly one update.

To run the framework, a JSON file containing the necessary parameters should be passed to the python interpreter. This JSON file should follow this format:

```json
{
	"model_name" : (string) arbitrary name given to the model,
	"model_path" : (string) the path to the PRISM model,
	"storm-conv" : (string) the path to the storm-conv binary,
	"csl_property_lb" : (string) CSL property that is going to be checked,
	"target_variable" : (string) the variable of interest in the CSL property,
	"target_value" : (string) the value of the variable of interest in the CSL property
}
```

To run the framework, this JSON file should be simply passed as an argument to the [Main.py](http://Main.py) script:

```bash
python Main.py file.json
```
